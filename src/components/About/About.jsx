                                                My journey encompasses crafting diverse websites,
                                                from designing login pages for social media giants like Facebook and

                                                Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                                                I've embraced modern technologies like ReactJS and NextJS to build
                                                dynamic and responsive web applications. Additionally,
                                                I've ventured into mobile app development using Flutter,
                                                bringing seamless experiences to handheld devices.
                                                On the server-side, I've mastered server-side scripting
                                                with PHP and explored C programming in operating systems.

                                                ensuring sleek and efficient user interfaces.
                                                My expertise extends to database management with MySQL and MongoDB,
                                                complemented by certifications from Cisco Networking Academy.
